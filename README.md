# Run JavaScript in Visual Studio Code

1. Install the [Code Runner Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)

2. Open the JavaScript code file in Text Editor, then use shortcut Control+Alt+N (or ⌃ Control+⌥ Option+N on macOS), or press F1 and then select/type Run Code, the code will run and the output will be shown in the Output Window.

Besides, you could select part of the JavaScript code and run the code snippet. The extension also works with unsaved files, so you can just create a file, change it to Javascript and write code fast (for when you just need to try something quick). Very convenient!
